        <li>1 Egg large</li>
        <li>1 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>1 tsp Baking Soda</li>

        <li>1/4 tsp Nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Prepare a loaf pan with butter, oil, or even Pam spray.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the melted butter and sugar. </li>
        <li>Add the bananas. Mash them then mix into the butter and sugar mixture. </li>
        <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract. Stir.</li>
        <li>Mix in the baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and flour. </li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
        <li>
            Bake for about 40 minutes or until an 
            inserted toothpick comes out clean. 
            OVEN TIMES VARY. Some people need 55 minutes. 
            Others need 30 minutes. Please use your own 
            judgment and the toothpick trick 
            (insert a wooden toothpick in the middle of 
            the bread. If it comes out clean, the bread 
            is done. If it comes out with batter on the 
            toothpick, please continue baking. It is not
            done). In a fairly new, convection oven, it
            takes around 40 minutes for my bread to be
            done.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let cool. For clean slices, please allow the bread to completely cool. </li>
    </ol>
